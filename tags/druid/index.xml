      <description>Hello! This post will likely be a bit shorter than the last. Today&amp;rsquo;s topic is a few thoughts about how complex it can be to parse human input, and how that interacts with Druid&amp;rsquo;s data model.
Progress I think I&amp;rsquo;m nearly finished tweaking the ingredient editor. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the better part of a month on just this one view and that might seem like overkill, but for software like this the user experience is the whole point so it&amp;rsquo;s important to get it right.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a couple of weeks since the last post, and as promised I&amp;rsquo;m back with some progress on the ingredient editor. The last post talked about my goals for this project, technical design decisions based on those goals, and my philosophy on starting challenging projects. This post is more of an experience report from my first few weeks of working with Druid.
Before we dig into Druid though, the progress in the last two weeks.</description>
