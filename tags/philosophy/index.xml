      <description>Something you might not know about me is that I&amp;rsquo;m an avid home cook. As such, I like to experiment in the kitchen, improvise new recipes, and modify existing ones. I also track my calorie and macronutrient intake. I have software tools for this, but I don&amp;rsquo;t like them and eventually I got fed up and decided to write my own.
I also thought it would be interesting to try working with the garage door up and writing more publicly about what I&amp;rsquo;m working on, so this is part one of an ongoing series where I do just that.</description>
